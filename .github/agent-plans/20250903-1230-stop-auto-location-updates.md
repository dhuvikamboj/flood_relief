## Goal
Stop automatic location updates when user manually sets location on the request relief page by clicking/dragging on the map.

## Requirements checklist
- [x] When user clicks on map to set location, stop GPS location watching
- [x] When user drags marker to set location, stop GPS location watching  
- [x] When user clicks "Get Current Location" button, resume GPS location watching
- [x] Reset manual location flag when form is submitted/reset

## Assumptions
- Location context continues to watch GPS in background by default
- Manual location setting should take precedence over automatic updates
- User should be able to resume automatic updates by clicking "Get Current Location"

## Plan
1. Add `locationManuallySet` state to track when location is set manually
2. Modify location auto-population useEffect to only update when `!locationManuallySet`
3. Set `locationManuallySet = true` in map click handler
4. Set `locationManuallySet = true` in marker drag handlers
5. Set `locationManuallySet = false` in handleGetCurrentLocation to resume watching
6. Reset flag when form is submitted

## Files to touch
- `/Users/davindersingh/projects/flood_relief/FloodReliefApp/src/pages/RequestForm.tsx`

## Validation plan
- Test clicking on map sets location and stops auto-updates
- Test dragging marker sets location and stops auto-updates  
- Test clicking "Get Current Location" resumes auto-updates
- Test form submission resets the manual location flag

## Progress log
- 2025-09-03 12:30: Added `locationManuallySet` state variable
- 2025-09-03 12:31: Modified location auto-population useEffect with manual check
- 2025-09-03 12:32: Updated map click handler to set manual flag
- 2025-09-03 12:33: Updated marker drag handlers to set manual flag
- 2025-09-03 12:34: Updated handleGetCurrentLocation to reset manual flag
- 2025-09-03 12:35: Added flag reset in form submission

## Final summary
Successfully implemented manual location override functionality. When users manually set their location by clicking on the map or dragging the marker, the app now stops automatically updating the location from GPS. Users can resume automatic location updates by clicking the "Get Current Location" button. The manual location flag is properly reset when the form is submitted.

Files modified: RequestForm.tsx
- Added locationManuallySet state
- Modified 3 useEffect hooks and event handlers
- Updated form submission to reset flag

## Follow-ups
- Consider adding visual indicator when location is manually set vs auto-updating
- Test on mobile devices to ensure touch interactions work properly
