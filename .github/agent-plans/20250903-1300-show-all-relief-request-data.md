## Goal
Enhance the relief requests display to show all available data fields from the API response, providing users with comprehensive information about each request.

## Requirements checklist
- [x] Update ReliefRequest interface to include all fields from API

- [x] Enhance list view to display additional information (address, contact, request type, distance, media counts)
- [x] Update map marker popups to show complete information
- [x] Add CSS styling for better organization of expanded information

## Assumptions
- All fields from the API response should be displayed when available
- Photos and videos arrays are JSON strings that need parsing
- Distance should be displayed with 1 decimal precision
- Media counts should be shown when attachments exist

## Plan
1. Update TypeScript interface to match API response structure
2. Enhance data parsing in fetchNearby function
3. Improve list item display with organized information layout
4. Update map marker popups with complete details
5. Add CSS styling for better readability
