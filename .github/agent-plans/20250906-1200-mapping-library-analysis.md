# Mapping Library Analysis and Recommendations

## Goal
Evaluate the best mapping library for the flood relief application and provide recommendations for improvements.

## Current Implementation Analysis
- **Library**: Leaflet v1.9.4
- **Tile Providers**: ESRI Satellite, OpenStreetMap, ESRI Terrain, OpenTopoMap
- **Features**: Custom SVG markers, popups, geolocation, layer switching
- **Platform**: Ionic React with Capacitor for mobile

## Recommendations

### 1. Stay with Leaflet (RECOMMENDED)
**Reasons:**
- Lightweight (~40KB) - critical for emergency scenarios
- No API costs or usage limits
- Excellent offline capabilities
- Strong mobile support
- Already implemented and working

**Suggested Enhancements:**
1. Add marker clustering for performance
2. Implement offline tile caching
3. Add heatmap visualization for resource density
4. Improve custom marker icons
5. Add better error handling for tile loading

### 2. Alternative Options Considered

#### MapBox GL JS
- **Pros**: Beautiful animations, vector tiles, 3D support
- **Cons**: API costs, usage limits, larger bundle, poor offline support
- **Verdict**: Not suitable for emergency relief app

#### Google Maps
- **Pros**: Familiar interface, good satellite imagery
- **Cons**: Expensive, strict limits, poor offline support
- **Verdict**: Not recommended for disaster relief

## Implementation Plan
1. Keep current Leaflet setup
2. Add performance optimizations
3. Enhance offline capabilities
4. Improve user experience with better markers and interactions

## Files Analyzed
- `/FloodReliefApp/src/hooks/useResourceMap.ts`
- `/FloodReliefApp/src/hooks/useLocation.ts`
- `/FloodReliefApp/src/components/ResourceMap.tsx`
- `/FloodReliefApp/src/components/RequestMap.tsx`
- `/FloodReliefApp/package.json`

## Decision
**Continue with Leaflet** as the primary mapping library with the suggested enhancements.
