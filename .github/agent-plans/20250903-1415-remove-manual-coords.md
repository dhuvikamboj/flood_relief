# Remove Manual Coordinate Entry - 2025-09-03

## Goal
Remove the manual coordinate entry functionality from the RequestForm component to simplify the user interface and ensure coordinates are only set via GPS or map interaction.

## Requirements checklist
- [x] Remove manual coordinate input fields (latitude/longitude)
- [x] Remove associated CSS styles for manual coordinate inputs
- [x] Keep location input readonly and auto-populated from GPS/map
- [x] Ensure TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- [x] Maintain existing GPS and map click functionality

## Assumptions and scope boundaries
- Location input should remain readonly and only populated from GPS or map clicks
- Manual coordinate entry was added for testing/debugging purposes
- GPS button and map interaction should continue to work normally
- No impact on form submission or backend functionality

## Plan
1. Remove manual coordinate input JSX from RequestForm component
2. Remove associated CSS styles from RequestForm.css
3. Verify location input remains readonly
4. Test GPS and map functionality still works
5. Ensure TypeScript compilation passes

## Files to touch
- `src/pages/RequestForm.tsx` (remove manual coordinate inputs)
- `src/pages/RequestForm.css` (remove manual coordinate styles)

## Validation plan
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Location input remains readonly
- GPS button functionality works
- Map click functionality works
- Form submission includes correct coordinates

## Progress log
- 2025-09-03 14:15: Removed manual coordinate input fields from RequestForm component
- 2025-09-03 14:20: Removed associated CSS styles (.manual-coords, .manual-coords-inputs)
- 2025-09-03 14:25: Verified location input remains readonly
- 2025-09-03 14:30: Confirmed TypeScript compilation passes without errors

## Final summary
Successfully removed the manual coordinate entry functionality from the RequestForm component. The location input now only accepts coordinates from GPS location or map clicks, simplifying the user interface and preventing potential user errors from manual coordinate entry.

## Files/sections touched
- **Modified**: `src/pages/RequestForm.tsx` - Removed manual coordinate input fields and associated JSX
- **Modified**: `src/pages/RequestForm.css` - Removed .manual-coords and .manual-coords-inputs CSS classes

## Follow-ups
- Test the RequestForm functionality to ensure GPS and map interactions work correctly
- Consider adding validation to ensure coordinates are set before form submission
- Could add a visual indicator when coordinates are successfully set
