Goal: Integrate Google Analytics 4 (GA4) using react-ga4 for tracking page views on all pages and events throughout the Flood Relief app.

Requirements:
- Install react-ga4 package
- Set up GA4 tracking with a measurement ID
- Initialize GA4 in the app
- Track page views on all route changes
- Add event tracking for key user interactions (form submissions, button clicks, etc.)
- Ensure tracking works across all pages and components

Assumptions and scope boundaries:
- Using GA4 measurement ID (will use placeholder, user needs to replace with actual ID)
- Tracking page views via React Router history
- Adding event tracking to major user actions like login, signup, form submissions
- Not tracking sensitive data (e.g., personal info in forms)
- Scope limited to the React/Ionic app in FloodReliefApp directory

Short contract:
- Inputs: None (will use placeholder GA ID)
- Outputs: Updated app with GA4 tracking
- Success criteria: GA4 initialized, page views tracked, events tracked on key actions
- Error modes: Invalid GA ID, network issues (handled gracefully)

Plan:
1. Create plan file (this file)
2. Install react-ga4 package
3. Create GA4 configuration and initialization
4. Set up page view tracking in App.tsx
5. Add event tracking to key components (Login, Signup, RequestForm, etc.)
6. Test build and ensure no errors

Files to touch:
- FloodReliefApp/package.json (add dependency)
- FloodReliefApp/src/App.tsx (initialize GA4, page tracking)
- FloodReliefApp/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx (track auth events)
- FloodReliefApp/src/pages/Login.tsx (track login events)
- FloodReliefApp/src/pages/Signup.tsx (track signup events)
- FloodReliefApp/src/pages/RequestForm.tsx (track form submissions)
- FloodReliefApp/src/pages/ResourceForm.tsx (track form submissions)

Validation plan:
- Build: npm run build -> PASS
- Lint: npm run lint -> PASS
- Tests: npm run test.unit -> PASS (if any)
- Smoke: App loads without errors, GA4 initialized

Rollback & safety plan:
- Revert package.json changes
- Remove GA4 initialization code
- Remove tracking calls from components
