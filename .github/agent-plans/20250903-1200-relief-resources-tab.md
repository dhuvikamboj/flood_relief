## Goal
Add a new tab for relief resources where people can list where the relief is, with the same functionality as reports.

## Requirements checklist
- [x] Create ReliefResource model
- [x] Create migration for relief_resources table
- [x] Create ReliefResourceController
- [x] Add API routes for relief resources
- [x] Create ReliefResources.tsx component (React)
- [x] Update routing to include the new tab
- [x] Test the new functionality

## Assumptions
- Relief resources will have similar fields to relief requests (location, contact, details, etc.)
- Resources will have types like "Food Distribution", "Medical Supplies", "Shelter", "Water Supply", etc.
- Same authentication and authorization as requests
- Same map and filtering functionality

## Plan
1. Create database migration for relief_resources table
2. Create ReliefResource model with relationships
3. Create ReliefResourceController with CRUD operations
4. Add API routes for resources
5. Create ReliefResources.tsx component based on Reports.tsx
6. Update app routing to include resources tab
7. Test the implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented a new "Relief Resources" tab with the same functionality as the reports tab. The implementation includes:

### Backend Changes:
- Created `relief_resources` table migration with fields for location, contact, resource type, capacity, availability, etc.
- Created `ReliefResource` model with proper relationships and casts
- Created `ReliefResourceController` with full CRUD operations (store, index, updateStatus, updateAvailability, destroy)
- Added API routes for resources with proper authentication middleware

### Frontend Changes:
- Created `ReliefResources.tsx` component based on `Reports.tsx` with adapted functionality for resources
- Updated `App.tsx` to include the new Resources tab with briefcase icon
- Added routing for the resources page

### Key Features:
- Map view with different icons for different resource types (food, medical, shelter, water, supplies)
- Filtering by status (active/inactive), availability (available/limited/unavailable), and resource type
- Sorting by distance, capacity, availability, date, and status
- Detailed resource cards with photos, videos, and comments
- CRUD operations for resource owners
- Same authentication and authorization as requests

The implementation is complete and ready for use!
