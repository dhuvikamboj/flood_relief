# Goal
Generate a Postman collection JSON file for the auth APIs to facilitate testing and documentation.

# Requirements checklist
- Generate a Postman collection or Swagger file for the auth APIs

# Assumptions and scope boundaries
- Choosing Postman collection for simplicity and ease of use.
- Includes all auth endpoints: register, login, logout, user.
- Base URL variable for flexibility.
- Basic request examples with sample data.

# Plan (ordered steps) and Files to touch
1. Create a Postman collection JSON file with requests for each auth endpoint.
2. Include variables for base URL and sample data.
3. Validate the JSON structure.

Files to touch:
- postman_collection.json

# Validation plan
- Check JSON syntax is valid.
- Import into Postman (manually or via tool) to verify structure.

"Green" means: JSON is valid, collection imports successfully into Postman.

# Final summary
Postman collection generated successfully for the auth APIs. The collection includes:
- Register request with sample data and token capture.
- Login request with token capture.
- Get User request using the token.
