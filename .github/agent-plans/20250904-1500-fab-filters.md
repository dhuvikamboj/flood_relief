# Move Filters to Floating FAB and Popover Plan

## Goal
Replace the inline filter controls with a floating action button (FAB) that opens a popover containing all filter options. This will create a cleaner, more mobile-friendly interface.

## Requirements Checklist
- [ ] Create a floating FAB positioned over the map
- [ ] Implement a popover that opens from the FAB
- [ ] Move all filter controls into the popover
- [ ] Maintain all existing filter functionality
- [ ] Add visual indicator when filters are active
- [ ] Ensure responsive design works well
- [ ] Keep the filter state when popover closes

## Assumptions and Scope Boundaries
- Keep existing filter logic and state management
- Use Ionic's IonFab and IonPopover components
- Position FAB in bottom-right corner (common UI pattern)
- Maintain current filter functionality exactly as-is
- Add visual feedback for active filters

## Plan (Ordered Steps)
1. Update ResourceFilters component to work inside a popover
2. Create a new FloatingFilters component that includes FAB + popover
3. Update ResourceMap to integrate the floating filters
4. Add active filter indicator to FAB
5. Test responsive behavior and functionality

## Files to Touch
- `/Users/davindersingh/projects/flood_relief/FloodReliefApp/src/components/ResourceFilters.tsx` (update for popover)
- `/Users/davindersingh/projects/flood_relief/FloodReliefApp/src/components/FloatingFilters.tsx` (new)
- `/Users/davindersingh/projects/flood_relief/FloodReliefApp/src/pages/ReliefResources.tsx` (update to use floating filters)
- `/Users/davindersingh/projects/flood_relief/FloodReliefApp/src/components/ResourceMap.tsx` (possibly update layout)

## Validation Plan
- FAB appears and is positioned correctly
- Popover opens/closes properly
- All filter functionality works as before
- Visual indicator shows when filters are active
- Component works on mobile and desktop
- No regression in existing functionality
