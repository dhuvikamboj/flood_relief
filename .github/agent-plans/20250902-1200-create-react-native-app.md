# Goal
Create an # Plan
1. Create the Expo project using npx create-expo-app (already done)
2. Navigate into the project directory
3. Install Expo Router (already done)
4. Set up app directory structure with _layout.js and screen files (index.js, profile.js)
5. Create login and signup screens (done)
6. Set up state management with Context API for auth
7. Modify App.js to use expo-router entry point (already done)
8. Create additional screen components if neededct Native app as the frontend for the flood relief project, integrated with Expo Router for file-based routing.

# Requirements checklist
- Initialize a new Expo project named FloodReliefApp
- Install Expo Router for file-based navigation
- Set up basic navigation structure with at least two screens (e.g., Home and Profile)
- Add login and signup screens
- Set up state management for auth and app state
- Ensure the app can connect to the Laravel backend API

# Assumptions
- User has Node.js and npm installed (inferred from existing package.json)
- Expo CLI is available via npx
- "React router navigation" and "route based navigation" refer to file-based routing like Expo Router
- The app will be placed in a subdirectory of the current workspace

# Plan
1. Create the Expo project using npx create-expo-app (already done)
2. Navigate into the project directory
3. Install Expo Router (already done)
4. Set up app directory structure with _layout.js and screen files (index.js, profile.js)
5. Create login and signup screens
6. Modify App.js to use expo-router entry point (already done)
7. Create additional screen components if needed

# Validation plan
- Run npm install to ensure dependencies are installed
- Start the Expo development server with npx expo start
- Verify navigation between screens works via file-based routing
- Check that the app structure is correct and no errors in console
