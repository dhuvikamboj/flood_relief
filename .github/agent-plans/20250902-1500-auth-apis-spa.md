# Goal
Generate authentication APIs for SPA using Laravel Sanctum, including register, login, logout, and user retrieval endpoints.

# Requirements checklist
- Generate auth APIs for SPA

# Assumptions and scope boundaries
- Using Laravel Sanctum for token-based authentication.
- Standard auth endpoints: POST /register, POST /login, POST /logout, GET /user (already exists).
- No frontend implementation, only backend APIs.
- User model exists and will be updated with HasApiTokens trait.

# Plan (ordered steps) and Files to touch
1. Update User model to include HasApiTokens trait for Sanctum.
2. Create AuthController with methods for register, login, logout.
3. Add API routes for register, login, logout in routes/api.php.
4. Validate by running tests and checking routes.

Files to touch:
- app/Models/User.php
- app/Http/Controllers/AuthController.php
- routes/api.php

# Validation plan
- Run `composer test` to ensure no breaking changes.
- Run `php artisan route:list` to verify new routes are registered.
- Manual test: Use tools like Postman to test endpoints (register, login, logout, user with token).

"Green" means: Tests pass, routes are listed, no errors in logs.

# Final summary
Auth APIs for SPA have been successfully implemented using Laravel Sanctum. The following endpoints are now available:
- POST /api/register: Register a new user and return API token.
- POST /api/login: Authenticate user and return API token.
- POST /api/logout: Revoke the current access token (requires auth).
- GET /api/user: Retrieve authenticated user info (requires auth).

Files touched:
- app/Models/User.php: Added HasApiTokens trait.
- app/Http/Controllers/AuthController.php: New controller with auth methods.
- routes/api.php: Added auth routes.

Validation: Tests pass, routes are registered, no errors detected. Ready for SPA integration.
