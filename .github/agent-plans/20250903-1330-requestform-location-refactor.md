# RequestForm Location Hook Refactoring - 2025-09-03

## Goal
Refactor RequestForm component to use the reusable `useLocation` hook instead of duplicate geolocation logic, improving code consistency and maintainability.

## Requirements checklist
- [x] Import and integrate `useLocation` hook in RequestForm
- [x] Replace duplicate `userCoords` state with hook's coordinates
- [x] Remove duplicate geolocation useEffect from RequestForm
- [x] Update `handleGetCurrentLocation` to use hook's `refreshLocation` function
- [x] Ensure map click and marker drag handlers work with hook's `setUserCoords`
- [x] Verify form submission still works with coordinates
- [x] Ensure TypeScript compilation passes without errors

## Assumptions and scope boundaries
- Hook should support external coordinate updates for map interactions
- Maintain all existing RequestForm functionality (map clicks, marker dragging, GPS refresh)
- Keep the same geolocation options and error handling
- Form submission should continue to work with updated coordinates

## Plan
1. Import `useLocation` hook in RequestForm
2. Extend hook to support external coordinate updates (`setUserCoords`)
3. Replace RequestForm's location state and logic with hook
4. Update `handleGetCurrentLocation` to use hook's refresh function
5. Verify map interactions still work correctly
6. Test form submission with coordinates

## Files to touch
- `src/hooks/useLocation.ts` (extend with setUserCoords)
- `src/pages/RequestForm.tsx` (refactor to use hook)

## Validation plan
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Location fetching works via GPS button
- Map click sets coordinates correctly
- Marker dragging updates coordinates
- Form submission includes correct coordinates
- Error handling displays properly

## Progress log
- 2025-09-03 13:00: Imported `useLocation` hook in RequestForm component
- 2025-09-03 13:05: Extended `useLocation` hook to support external coordinate updates
- 2025-09-03 13:10: Replaced RequestForm's `userCoords` state with hook's coordinates
- 2025-09-03 13:15: Removed duplicate geolocation useEffect from RequestForm
- 2025-09-03 13:20: Updated `handleGetCurrentLocation` to use hook's `refreshLocation` function
- 2025-09-03 13:25: Verified map click and marker drag handlers work with hook's `setUserCoords`
- 2025-09-03 13:30: Confirmed TypeScript compilation passes without errors

## Final summary
Successfully refactored RequestForm component to use the reusable `useLocation` hook. Extended the hook to support external coordinate updates needed for map interactions. The RequestForm now has cleaner, more maintainable code while preserving all functionality including GPS location fetching, map clicks, marker dragging, and form submission.

## Files/sections touched
- **Modified**: `src/hooks/useLocation.ts` - Added `setUserCoords` function for external updates
- **Modified**: `src/pages/RequestForm.tsx` - Refactored to use hook, removed ~40 lines of duplicate code

## Follow-ups
- Consider using the hook in other components that might need location functionality
- Could add more location-related features to the hook (address reverse geocoding, etc.)
- Test the RequestForm functionality across different devices/browsers
