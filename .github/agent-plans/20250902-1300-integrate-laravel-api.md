# Goal
Integrate the Expo React Native app with the Laravel backend API for authentication, data fetching, and real-time communication to create a fully functional flood relief mobile application with route-based navigation.

# Requirements checklist
- Set up API client in React Native app for communicating with Laravel backend
- Implement real authentication (login/signup) using Laravel Sanctum
- Add API calls for fetching flood reports and user data
- Implement real-time updates for flood alerts (using WebSockets or polling)
- Add error handling and loading states
- Implement authentication guards to protect routes
- Switch from file-based to route-based navigation using React Navigation
- Test the integration end-to-endgrate the Expo React Native app with the Laravel backend API for authentication, data fetching, and real-time communication to create a fully functional flood relief mobile application.

# Requirements checklist
- Set up API client in React Native app for communicating with Laravel backend
- Implement real authentication (login/signup) using Laravel Sanctum
- Add API calls for fetching flood reports and user data
- Implement real-time updates for flood alerts (using WebSockets or polling)
- Add error handling and loading states
- Implement authentication guards to protect routes âœ…
- Test the integration end-to-end

# Assumptions
- Laravel backend is running and accessible (e.g., at http://localhost:8000)
- Laravel Sanctum is properly configured for API authentication
- User has basic knowledge of API integration
- The app will use fetch or axios for HTTP requests

# Plan
1. Install axios or use fetch for API calls
2. Create API service files for authentication and data endpoints
3. Update login/signup screens to use real API calls
4. Add API calls to fetch and submit flood reports
5. Implement token storage and refresh logic
6. Add loading indicators and error handling
7. Test authentication flow and data synchronization

# Validation plan
- Start Laravel backend with `php artisan serve`
- Run React Native app with `npx expo start`
- Test login/signup with valid/invalid credentials
- Verify data fetching and submission works
- Check error handling for network issues
- Ensure token persistence across app restarts

# Todos
- Install HTTP client library
- Create API service modules
- Implement auth API calls
- Implement data API calls
- Add error handling and loading states
- Test integration

# Done
# Done
- Created plan file
- Installed HTTP client and storage
- Created API service modules
- Implemented auth API calls
- Updated screens with real API integration
- Added loading states and error handling

# Decisions
- Use axios for HTTP requests (more feature-rich than fetch)
- Store tokens in AsyncStorage for persistence
- Use Laravel Sanctum for API authentication
- Implement basic error handling with user-friendly messages
