## Goal
Apply the same manual location override functionality to ResourceForm.tsx that was implemented in RequestForm.tsx.

## Requirements checklist
- [x] When user clicks on map to set location, stop GPS location watching
- [x] When user drags marker to set location, stop GPS location watching
- [x] When user clicks "Get Current Location" button, resume GPS location watching
- [x] Reset manual location flag when form is submitted/reset

## Assumptions
- ResourceForm.tsx has similar structure to RequestForm.tsx
- Location context continues to watch GPS in background by default
- Manual location setting should take precedence over automatic updates

## Plan
1. Add `locationManuallySet` state to track when location is set manually
2. Modify location auto-population useEffect to only update when `!locationManuallySet`
3. Set `locationManuallySet = true` in map click handler
4. Set `locationManuallySet = true` in marker drag handlers
5. Set `locationManuallySet = false` in handleGetCurrentLocation to resume watching
6. Reset flag when form is submitted

## Files to touch
- `/Users/davindersingh/projects/flood_relief/FloodReliefApp/src/pages/ResourceForm.tsx`

## Validation plan
- Test clicking on map sets location and stops auto-updates
- Test dragging marker sets location and stops auto-updates
- Test clicking "Get Current Location" resumes auto-updates
- Test form submission resets the manual location flag

## Progress log
- 2025-09-03 12:45: Added `locationManuallySet` state variable
- 2025-09-03 12:46: Modified location auto-population useEffect with manual check
- 2025-09-03 12:47: Updated map click handler to set manual flag
- 2025-09-03 12:48: Updated marker drag handlers to set manual flag
- 2025-09-03 12:49: Updated handleGetCurrentLocation to reset manual flag
- 2025-09-03 12:50: Added flag reset in form submission

## Final summary
Successfully applied the same manual location override functionality to ResourceForm.tsx. The changes mirror those made to RequestForm.tsx, ensuring consistent behavior across both forms.

Files modified: ResourceForm.tsx
- Added locationManuallySet state
- Modified 3 useEffect hooks and event handlers
- Updated form submission to reset flag

## Follow-ups
- Test both RequestForm and ResourceForm to ensure consistent behavior
- Consider extracting this logic into a custom hook for reusability
