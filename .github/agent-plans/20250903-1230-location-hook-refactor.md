# Location Hook Refactoring - 2025-09-03

## Goal
Refactor location fetching logic from Reports component into a reusable custom hook for better code organization and reusability.

## Requirements checklist
- [x] Extract location-related state and logic from Reports component
- [x] Create useLocation custom hook with proper TypeScript interfaces
- [x] Update Reports component to use the new hook
- [x] Remove duplicate location logic and state variables
- [x] Ensure all location functionality still works (refresh, accuracy, error handling)
- [x] Verify TypeScript compilation passes without errors

## Assumptions and scope boundaries
- Hook should be reusable across multiple components
- Maintain all existing location functionality (watching, accuracy, error handling)
- Keep the same geolocation API options (high accuracy, timeout, etc.)
- Hook should handle cleanup automatically

## Plan
1. Create `src/hooks/useLocation.ts` with location logic
2. Define TypeScript interfaces for location data
3. Extract state variables and useEffect logic from Reports
4. Update Reports component imports and usage
5. Remove old location code from Reports
6. Test compilation and functionality

## Files to touch
- `src/hooks/useLocation.ts` (new)
- `src/pages/Reports.tsx` (refactor)

## Validation plan
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Location functionality works in Reports component
- Refresh location button works correctly
- Error handling displays properly
- Map integration still functions

## Progress log
- 2025-09-03 12:30: Created useLocation hook with proper interfaces and logic
- 2025-09-03 12:35: Updated Reports component imports to include useLocation hook
- 2025-09-03 12:40: Replaced location state variables with hook destructuring
- 2025-09-03 12:45: Removed old geolocation useEffect from Reports component
- 2025-09-03 12:50: Updated refresh location button to use hook's refreshLocation function
- 2025-09-03 12:55: Verified TypeScript compilation passes without errors

## Final summary
Successfully refactored location fetching logic into a reusable custom hook. The `useLocation` hook encapsulates all geolocation functionality including state management, error handling, and cleanup. The Reports component is now cleaner and the location logic is reusable across other components if needed.

## Files/sections touched
- **Created**: `src/hooks/useLocation.ts` - New custom hook with location logic
- **Modified**: `src/pages/Reports.tsx` - Refactored to use hook, removed ~50 lines of duplicate code

## Follow-ups
- Consider using the hook in other components that might need location data
- Could add additional features to hook like location permissions checking
- Test hook functionality across different browsers/devices
