Goal
- Add a simple landing page that shows two maps side-by-side (or stacked on mobile): one for "Where help is needed" (relief requests) and one for "Where help is available" (relief resources).

Requirements checklist
- Create a new React/Ionic page `src/pages/Landing.tsx` that displays two maps using existing `RequestMap` and `ResourceMap` components.
- Fetch nearby relief requests and resources using the app's API hooks/services.
- Add minimal CSS `src/pages/Landing.css` for responsive two-column layout.
- Wire the page into routing in `src/App.tsx` at the route `/landing`.
- Add an entry point from `src/pages/Home.tsx` (a card) linking to `/landing`.

Assumptions
- Use the existing `useLocation` context to obtain `userCoords`.
- Use existing `useResources` hook to load resources; requests will be fetched inline similarly to `Reports.tsx`.

Plan
1. Create `Landing.tsx` page that imports `RequestMap` and `ResourceMap`, loads requests and resources, and renders them side-by-side.
2. Add `Landing.css` for layout and small styling.
3. Update `src/App.tsx` to register `/landing` route.
4. Add a card in `src/pages/Home.tsx` that links to `/landing`.
5. Quick smoke check (type-level) â€” keep changes minimal.

Validation plan
- Confirm project builds locally (not run here). Manually verify TypeScript imports and that app compiles.

Progress log
- 2025-09-05 12:00 - Created plan and implementing files: Landing page, CSS, route, Home link.

Done
- Created landing page and wired route + Home quick link.

Decisions
- Keep fetch logic for requests simplified (no debounce) to reduce footprint and reuse existing mapping code from `Reports.tsx`.
