## Goal
Brainstorm and prioritize additional features for the flood relief app to enhance functionality and user experience.

## Current State Analysis
- âœ… Basic relief request creation and viewing
- âœ… Location-based search with radius control
- âœ… User authentication (basic)
- âœ… Media attachment support
- âœ… Map integration with markers
- âœ… Status field exists but not fully utilized

## Quick Wins (Can implement immediately)
1. **Status Updates**: Add status change functionality to existing requests
2. **User Profiles**: Enhance user model with additional fields
3. **Emergency Contacts**: Add quick access to emergency services
4. **Request Filtering**: Add filters by status, type, priority
5. **Export Functionality**: Allow data export for coordination

## Questions for User:
- What user group are you targeting most? (victims, volunteers, coordinators?)
- What's your primary use case? (immediate response vs long-term recovery?)
- Do you have access to emergency service APIs?
- What's your timeline for additional features?

## Next Steps:
1. Choose 2-3 high-priority features to implement first
2. Create detailed implementation plans for selected features
3. Start with the quickest wins to show immediate value
